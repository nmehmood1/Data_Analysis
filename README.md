# Data_Analysis
Data analysis projects of varying sizes using various methods to answer various questions. 
I will also add small projects here as I begin to learn machine-learning techniques.

Cricket Chirps vs Temp - Linear regression. Showing import of data and some cleaning before performing exploratory data analysis and regression with hypothesis test.

Exploring Lego Database - Importing data with pandas dataframes and answering some questions by grouping, sorting, and visualising data.
